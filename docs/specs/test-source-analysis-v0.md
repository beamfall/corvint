Intent status: accepted under the owner's standing auto-accept (2026-10-11; V1-1587, V1-1589, V1-1592, V1-1698)
Delivery status: experimental
Authoritative inputs: V1-1587 / GitHub #1030, V1-1589 / GitHub #1032 and V1-1592 / GitHub #1035
owner requests, and V1-1698 / GitHub #1082 for shared-constant keys, agent-drafted and accepted under the owner's standing auto-accept (2026-10-11);
AGENTS.md invariants 1, 2, 4, 7 and 8.

## Agent digest
- Claim: Read-only analysis of committed JS/TS tests selects needed setup projects, lints changed test lines and lists candidate duplicate tests.
- Status: accepted under the owner's standing auto-accept (2026-10-11; V1-1587, V1-1589, V1-1592, V1-1698)/experimental
- Exists: `internal/testsource`, `internal/contextindex/setup_select.go` and the experimental `corvint tests setup-select`, `corvint tests lint` and `corvint tests duplicates` commands.
- Blocked on: an MCP tool for setup-select and a preflight lint hookup are not built; real-suite qualification is NOT_RUN.
- Read next: Requirements; Boundaries and failure modes; Delivery.

## User and verified baseline

An adopter with a Playwright-style suite runs many specs against shared setup projects that seed
data contexts, and reviews test changes for quality and duplication by hand. At
`55abb815c4c20a771363d38e315ddfddf14c6972` Corvint parses the declared string-key registry
dialect (`internal/contextindex/registry.go`) and resolves web imports, but nothing maps a spec set
to the setup projects it needs, lints test sources, or compares test assertions. The simpler
baseline is running every setup project for every spec, reviewing by eye, and grepping for repeated
`expect` lines. Success is a deterministic, bounded answer that falls back to the safe superset
(ALL setup files) or an explicit uncertainty whenever it cannot prove a narrower one.

## Requirements

### Shared reading

- `TSA-V0-010`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1589, V1-1592) Lint and duplicates MUST read
  only committed Git content at an explicit revision (`git cat-file`, `ls-tree`, `diff`), never the
  worktree, and MUST tokenize with the application map's JavaScript/TypeScript lexer
  (`appmap.LexJS`) rather than a second lexer. Test files are JS/TS files whose stem ends in `.spec`
  or `.test`; page-object files are JS/TS files under a `pages`, `page-objects`, `pageobjects` or
  `pom` directory or whose stem ends in `.page` or `Page`. Declarations are `test`/`it`/`specify`
  (and `x`/`f` variants) calls with a title and callback, nested in `describe`/`context`/`suite`
  calls, with `only`, `skip`, `fixme`, `fail`, `slow`, `serial` and `parallel` modifiers; a
  `test.skip(...)` call without a callback is a runtime annotation. A file the lexer cannot place,
  or with unbalanced brackets, is listed as uncertain rather than silently dropped. At most 5000
  files of at most 1 MiB each (64 MiB in total) are read; more refuses with `tests-bound-exceeded`.
  Changed paths come from a NUL-delimited `git diff --name-only -z` inventory, and every patch
  header MUST decode (Git's trailing tab after a name with a space, C-quoting) to an inventory path
  or the read refuses with `tests-source-unavailable`. Diff reads MUST be independent of Git
  attributes, repository diff configuration and external drivers (`--text`, `--no-textconv`,
  `--no-ext-diff`, fixed `a/` and `b/` prefixes), so no local attribute can hide a hunk (amended
  2026-10-17 under the standing auto-accept after the PR #1054 review).
- `TSA-V0-011`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1587, V1-1589) Comments MUST be returned apart
  from tokens, so a mention inside a comment never counts as code (an import, a registry lookup, an
  assertion), and annotations are read from comments only.

### Setup selection (V1-1587)

- `TSA-V0-001`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1587) `corvint tests setup-select --specs
  PATH[,PATH...]` MUST list the setup files (JS/TS files whose stem ends in `.setup` or `.seed`)
  that the named spec files reach at the revision. A spec reaches a file through a static import,
  `export ... from`, a literal `import()` or a literal `require()`, transitively, skipping type-only
  imports. It also reaches a setup file through a literal key of a declared string-key registry
  (the AMAP registry dialect): the key's bound module is a data context, and every setup file that
  imports that module directly is selected and is itself traversed like any reached file, so its
  own setup dependencies are selected and its unresolved imports return ALL (amended 2026-10-17 after
  the PR #1054 review). Mode is `selected`.
- `TSA-V0-002`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1587) A registry declaration file and a hub
  (a non-setup file that imports every setup file in a universe of at least two) MUST NOT be
  followed and MUST be listed under `notFollowed` with reason `registry` or `hub`, so a barrel never
  widens a selection to everything.
- `TSA-V0-003`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1587) When the closure cannot be proved, the
  result MUST be mode `all` with every setup file and at least one typed reason. The setup universe
  is every tracked setup path at the revision, including generated or oversized files the index does
  not read, so ALL is the whole safe superset (amended 2026-10-17 after the PR #1054 review). Reasons: `computed-lookup` (a
  non-literal registry key, `import()` or `require()`), `unknown-key` (a literal key the registry
  does not declare), `shared-constant-key-unresolved` (TSA-V0-007), `registry-unresolved`, `missing-path` (a spec that is not a clean, tracked JS/TS
  path at the revision), `empty-spec-list`, `import-unresolved`, `source-unreadable` or
  `bound-exceeded` (at most 10 000 files in the closure, 100 reasons).
- `TSA-V0-004`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1587) A comment-only mention of an import or a
  registry key MUST NOT select anything (TSA-V0-011).
- `TSA-V0-005`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1587) The JSON output (schema
  `corvint-tests-setup-select/0`) MUST record the full revision, the specs, the universe size and an
  `inputDigest` (`sha256:` over the sorted path and blob of every file read, the registries and the
  application-map manifests), deterministic across calls. `--format lines` MUST print only the setup
  paths, one per line, usable as a test provider's setup project list.
- `TSA-V0-006`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1698 / GitHub #1082) A shared constant is an
  exported object literal (`export const|let|var NAME [: T] = {`, `export default {`, or a local
  object constant exported through `export { NAME [as ALIAS] }`). An import of it is followed through
  `export * from`, `export * as NS from` and `export { A as B } from` re-exports, renamed imports and
  `NS.NAME` namespace members (also nested, `NS.INNER.NAME`, and `require("m").NAME` or
  `import("m").NAME` with a literal module), at most 8 hops. An `export *` cycle MUST NOT hide a
  constant another path reaches: a resolution shaped by a module already being resolved or by a
  bound is never cached (amended 2026-10-18 after the PR #1096 review). A read is also seen in the
  module that declares the constant (`export const C = {...}; ... C.key`). When a reached file
  reads a literal property of a
  shared constant (`C.key`, `C?.key`, `C!.key`, `C["key"]`, `C?.["key"]`, a `${}` template
  substitution, or a `{ key, key: alias } = C` destructuring), every setup file that reads the same
  literal property of the same constant MUST be selected and traversed like a registry seeder
  (TSA-V0-001); a setup file that reads that constant only non-literally is also selected while any
  key of it is reached. A spec that reaches no shared constant is unaffected: it stays `selected`,
  with an empty list when nothing else is reached. `typeof C`, import and export clauses and
  comments (TSA-V0-011) are not reads, nor is a declaration that shadows the name (`const|let|var|
  function|class C`, `C =>`, or a simple `function`, arrow or `catch` parameter `C`); reads of a
  shadowing binding are attributed to the imported constant, which can only over-select.
- `TSA-V0-007`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1698 / GitHub #1082) A reached read of a
  shared constant that is not a literal property (a computed `C[k]`, a whole-object use such as
  `use(C)` or `Object.keys(C)`, or a namespace used other than as `NS.NAME`) MUST return mode `all`
  with reason `shared-constant-key-unresolved`, naming the file and line, whenever a setup file not
  already selected reads the same constant (for a namespace, any shared constant); it MUST NOT fail
  open to `selected`. A reached read the selector cannot attribute to one constant MUST return ALL
  the same way whenever an unselected setup file reads any shared constant: a namespace used as a
  value, a literal `require("m")` or `import("m")` used other than as `.NAME` (CommonJS and dynamic
  import bindings are not resolved), a re-export chain past 8 hops or 4096 export-table lookups, a
  re-export through an unreadable or unresolved module, or a template literal whose `${}`
  substitutions nest deeper than 8 (amended 2026-10-18 after the PR #1096 review). While any
  shared-constant read is reached, an unselected setup file holding such a read itself MUST return
  ALL with `shared-constant-key-unresolved` naming that setup file and line, and an unreadable setup
  file adds `source-unreadable`. Reaching an analysis bound is never the same as "not a constant".

### Lint (V1-1589)

- `TSA-V0-012`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1589) `corvint tests lint --base REV [--rev
  REV]` MUST lint the test and page-object files at the revision and, by default, report only
  findings whose line range touches a line added or changed since `--base`, or strictly contains a
  deletion (`scope: changed-lines`); `--all-lines` reads every test and page-object file at the
  revision, changed or not, and reports every finding (`scope: all-lines`) (amended 2026-10-17 after
  the PR #1054 review). An unknown revision refuses with `tests-invalid-revision`.
- `TSA-V0-013`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1589) The rule set MUST be closed, with stable
  IDs: `no-assertion` (a test with no assertion call), `weak-assertion-only` (every assertion is a
  visibility or URL matcher), `conditional-assertion` (an assertion inside `if`, `switch`, a ternary
  or `catch`), `swallowed-wait-error` (a wait whose error is caught and dropped), `fixed-wait`
  (`waitForTimeout`, or `setTimeout`, `sleep`, `delay`, `pause` or `wait` with a number),
  `tautological-assertion` (`expect` of a literal, or `toBe`/`toEqual`/`toStrictEqual` of the subject
  itself), `brittle-selector` (an XPath, positional or CSS-class selector, or `.nth(N)`), and `skip-only-without-reason` (`.only`, or
  a skip/fixme without a reason string).
- `TSA-V0-014`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1589) Every rule MUST have a positive fixture
  that fires it and a negative fixture that does not.
- `TSA-V0-015`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1589) A comment `corvint-lint-allow RULE:
  REASON` on the finding's line, or alone on the line above it, MUST suppress exactly RULE there and
  nothing else. One without a reason (`missing-reason`) or naming an unknown rule (`unknown-rule`)
  suppresses nothing. Every in-scope or applied suppression MUST be echoed with whether it was used.
- `TSA-V0-016`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1589) `--json` output (schema
  `corvint-tests-lint/0`) MUST be byte-identical across runs over the same inputs. Exit status MUST be
  0 with no findings, 1 with findings and 2 on any refusal.

### Duplicates (V1-1592)

- `TSA-V0-020`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1592) `corvint tests duplicates [--ref REV]`
  MUST normalise each non-skipped test's `expect` chains (canonical token rendering, so quoting and
  line breaks do not matter, keeping a regular expression's source and a template's substitution
  expressions so different patterns or expressions never render alike), drop a line held by more than `--max-line-tests` tests (default 5,
  range 2..100), and report pairs of tests in different files that share at least two remaining lines
  with a Jaccard score at least `--threshold` (default 0.5, range (0,1]). A test is identified as
  `path :: describe > title`, with ` [n]` for a repeat. Pairs are sorted by score, then identifiers.
  Decisions are applied to every pair first; then at most 1000 unresolved and 1000 resolved pairs are
  listed (`truncated`), while `unresolvedCount` and `resolvedCount` count them all (amended
  2026-10-17 after the PR #1054 review).
- `TSA-V0-021`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1592) With `--gate TICKET --base REV` only pairs
  where at least one test was added or changed since the base (an added or changed line in its span,
  or a deletion strictly inside it) MUST be considered, the changed tests are listed, and the command
  exits 1 while `unresolvedCount` is above zero, including pairs beyond the listed bound; report mode
  exits 0 (amended 2026-10-17 after the PR #1054 review).
- `TSA-V0-022`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1592) The project-owned, committed file
  `.corvint/test-duplicates.json` (schema `corvint-test-duplicate-decisions/0`, at most 1 MiB and
  10 000 decisions, read at the analysed revision) MUST resolve a pair by a `distinct-from` decision
  with a non-empty `reason` or a `covered-by` decision with a non-empty `obligation`. A decision
  without its reason or obligation, of an unknown kind, or naming an invalid pair resolves nothing
  and is listed under `ignoredDecisions` with its problem. A malformed file (unknown fields, wrong
  schema, trailing data) refuses with `tests-decisions-invalid`.
- `TSA-V0-023`: (standing auto-accept, 2026-10-11; V1-1592) Every report MUST state that pairs are
  candidates for review, not verdicts.

## Refusals

Every command exits 2 with one JSON object `{"code", "error", "ok": false}` on stderr and nothing on
stdout when it refuses: `tests-invalid-arguments` (usage), `tests-invalid-revision` (a revision that
is not a commit), `tests-invalid-option` (a threshold or cutoff out of range, or `--gate` without
`--base`), `tests-source-unavailable` (a Git or index read failed), `tests-bound-exceeded`,
`tests-decisions-invalid` and `tests-output-unavailable` (stdout could not be written).

## Decision file format

```json
{"schema": "corvint-test-duplicate-decisions/0",
 "decisions": [
  {"decision": "distinct-from", "test": "e2e/a.spec.ts :: cart > adds", "other": "e2e/b.spec.ts :: adds",
   "reason": "a checks the signed-in cart, b the guest basket"},
  {"decision": "covered-by", "test": "e2e/c.spec.ts :: adds", "other": "e2e/a.spec.ts :: cart > adds",
   "obligation": "CART-001"}]}
```

The pair is unordered. The file belongs to the project and is edited by people; Corvint only reads
it.

## Boundaries and failure modes

Non-goals: running tests, reading uncommitted changes, rewriting tests, judging whether a pair is a
real duplicate, languages other than JS/TS, test frameworks without `test`/`it` and
`describe` calls, an MCP tool for setup-select, and a preflight requirement for clean lint
(issue #1032 AC5). The two missing pieces are residuals of V1-1587 and V1-1589.

Failure modes: the lexer is heuristic around regular expressions and JSX, so an uncertain file is
listed and its findings may be incomplete. Setup selection trusts declared registries and import
syntax; a setup that is reached only through runtime configuration (for example a Playwright
`dependencies` entry) is not seen, so `selected` is only as complete as the static import graph. A
false-negative lint rule is possible for an assertion helper not named `expect*`, `assert*`,
`verify*` or `should*`. Duplicate scores compare assertion text only: two tests with the same
assertions over different setup are reported, and two tests that check the same behaviour through
different assertions are not.

Shared-constant keys (TSA-V0-006/007) over-select by design: every setup that reads a reached key is
selected, even one that only reads it for a different purpose, and a read through a parameter or
local that shadows the constant's name counts as a read of the constant. Non-goals that therefore
fail closed through TSA-V0-007 rather than being resolved: local aliasing of the object
(`const d = C`), spread, CommonJS `require` and dynamic `import()` bindings of a constant, keys built
at runtime, chains longer than 8 hops, templates nested deeper than 8, and a destructured or method
parameter that shadows the name (read as a whole-object use). The selector does no scope analysis.
A shared constant written by a setup at runtime is not seen, nor is a JSON module's object.

## Implementation, rollout and rollback

Parsing lives in `internal/testsource` (lint, duplicates, Git reads) and
`internal/contextindex/setup_select.go` (setup closure on the revision index); CLI parsing is in
`cmd/corvint/tests.go`. The lexer gains only a comment-collecting variant and an exported view. This
additive experimental profile changes no Core profile or persisted format. Rollback removes the
dispatch line, the help entries and the two packages' new files; there is no data migration.

## Acceptance evidence

Synthetic Git repositories: a registry-keyed spec selects its context's setup only; a hub and the
registry are not followed; comment-only mentions select nothing; computed, unknown, missing and empty
inputs return ALL with typed reasons; a spec reading `SHARED.scenario_a` (the #1082 fixture, also
through a fixture file, a barrel, a renamed re-export, a namespace member, a template substitution
or destructuring) selects only the setup reading the same key, while a computed `SHARED[k]`, a
whole-object use or a namespace used as a value returns ALL with `shared-constant-key-unresolved`;
the PR #1096 review forms (an `export * as` re-export, an `export *` cycle, exactly 8 hops, a read
in the declaring module, `require("m").NAME` and shadowing parameters) select, while a 9-hop setup,
a namespace-valued setup read, literal `require()`/`import()` bindings and a template nested 9 deep
return ALL,
and a spec reaching no shared constant stays `selected` with an empty list; the digest is stable and changes with the spec list. Each lint
rule fires on its positive fixture and not on its negative one; changed-lines scope excludes old
findings; suppressions apply to exactly the named rule and are echoed. Duplicates pair normalised
lines across files, honour the cutoff, gate on changed tests and resolve with reasoned decisions.
